I"ø<p><strong>As a Type-A, I like to finish my taxes the moment the new year begins. Until recently, this required entire days of unpleasant receipt sorting and categorizing, but I‚Äôve now perfected a system so that a few minutes of work here and there throughout the year mean my taxes are totally ready to file on January 15!</strong></p>

<p>I‚Äôve got self-employment, K-1s, a W2 ‚Ä¶ the works. This approach is most useful for self-employment deductions, which are the biggest time suck (and documentation burden) for me, but it can be useful for other deductions too.</p>

<p><strong>Sign up for Expensify</strong></p>

<p>My approach uses <a href="https://www.expensify.com/">Expensify</a>, which costs around $5 a month. It‚Äôs easily worth much more than that to me in saved time and headache. (And Expensify itself is a business deduction!) In a nutshell, you can forward email receipts and photograph paper receipts from your phone, then quickly tag them to generate reports, deduction amounts, etc.</p>

<p>You can also use it to get reimbursed from clients for travel and other expenses.</p>

<p><strong>Set up Categories</strong></p>

<p>You want to create Categories that match your tax deduction categories. For business expenses, these lines on your Schedule C are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Advertising</li>
  <li>Car and truck expenses</li>
  <li>Commissions and fees</li>
  <li>Contract labor</li>
  <li>Depletion</li>
  <li>Depreciation and section 179 expense deduction</li>
  <li>Employee benefit programs</li>
  <li>Insurance</li>
  <li>Interest</li>
  <li>Legal and professional services</li>
  <li>Office expense</li>
  <li>Pension and profit-sharing plans</li>
  <li>Rent or lease</li>
  <li>Repairs and maintenance</li>
  <li>Supplies</li>
  <li>Taxes and licenses</li>
  <li>Travel</li>
  <li>Travel: Deductible meals</li>
  <li>Utilities</li>
  <li>Wages</li>
  <li>Other expenses</li>
  <li>Expenses for business use of your home</li>
</ul>

<p>Only create those categories that apply to you (check last year‚Äôs Schedule C if you‚Äôre not sure).</p>

<p>You may also want to create categories for other deductions that apply to you, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Automobile registration fees</li>
  <li>Donations</li>
  <li>Medical expenses</li>
  <li>Mortgage interest</li>
  <li>Solar system equipment</li>
  <li>Taxes (local)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Set up Reports</strong></p>

<p>I have one main report for the calendar year called ‚ÄúSelf-Employment Expenses 20XX.‚Äù Each year I create a new report for that year.</p>

<p>I also use reports when I need to submit expenses for reimbursement, one report per reimbursement request. The Report automatically generates a PDF with a summary of expenses and a copy of each receipt.</p>

<p>I used to make more specific reports like ‚ÄúDonations 2018‚Äù and ‚ÄúHome Office Expenses 2018‚Äù but discovered that was overkill ‚Äî the categories take care of this for me already.</p>

<p><strong>Optional: Tags</strong></p>

<p>While not necessary for my taxes, if you want to generate your own reports on expenses by different clients or types of work, you can create and assign Tags. I personally use these for buckets of work (e.g. <a href="https://layeraleph.com/">Layer Aleph</a>, TaskTackler).</p>
